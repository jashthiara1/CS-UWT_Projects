The final report can be read here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KjzrCEd3yYFqdzvx6OdP41BHYk12YSUP/view?usp=sharing--!!

The way to run our project is to simply visit the url, https://34.82.237.225/. 
The development platform used was Google cloud platform. We set up a VM instance, myphpdamin, and ICEcoder similar to assignment 3 of this course. 
Visting https://34.82.237.225/Icecoder, will show the structure of our files (password is: Finalgroup1!. They are all within the folder called [ROOT]
The index serves as the homepage and a template for the rest of our files. There is also a aboutus file which is similar to index and only provides html content and no queries.
The rest are php files designated to handle our queries (properties.php, amenities.php, propDeposit.php, lessDeposit.php, config.php).
Asides from this there is one logo.png which holds our group image that is displayed on each page. We hope this project is simply to deploy!
