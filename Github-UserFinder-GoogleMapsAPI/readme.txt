Essentially my html utilizes github to access user information. We display many of these such as followers, following, uploads, their location, and their avatar. The location is then passed onto a class called create google tab which creates a new card populated with the users avatar and location. The user can then type in the location to see where exactly the git hub user is on google maps! I wanted to create this where it would automatically enter the location information, although this was very difficult as there was not one format. I saw many locations which were in latitude only, made up locations, or even random words. I really enjoyed this assignment and I plan on making more updates and adding a different api besides github with the google maps.  

side note:

sadly I had finished the program and everything was working, but then the github accounts would not appear. I assumed I had run out of API requests since I had not altered the code from when it did work, so just incase I will include an image of how the results looked when it worked. 

note: Google maps API currently not working as my student plan expired after graduation.
