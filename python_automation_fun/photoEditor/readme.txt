Simple python automation to edit photos. Just place whatever desired photos into the images folder and run the program! The code will loop through the photos
and add the filters! You can use the PIL documentation to add/remove filters. 

make sure to instal PIL before in your virtual environment ! - > python -m pip install --upgrade Pillow
