Some of the work I am proud of and have done at the University of Washington Tacoma while getting my bachelors degree. All of the projects are coded correctly, although some of the API keys have expired after my membership
with chatgpt, googlemaps, google cloud platforms had ended. If the user obtains there own API key they can use these programs for the desired purpose. 

Note: Some of the jupyter projects have large files sizes even though they are not close to as many projects done for other languages. Because of this the display of the program language percentages for the repository is not accurate.
